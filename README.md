# Flutter BLoC Template with Clean Architecture

A production-ready Flutter template project implementing Clean Architecture principles with BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. This template provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

## 📖 About

This project is a comprehensive Flutter template that demonstrates the implementation of Clean Architecture and the BLoC pattern in a real-world application context. It's designed to serve as a starting point for developers who want to build robust, scalable, and maintainable Flutter applications.

The template emphasizes several key architectural principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: The project strictly follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, and Data) to ensure code maintainability and testability.

2. **BLoC Pattern**: State management is implemented using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, providing a predictable state management solution that separates business logic from the UI.

3. **Dependency Injection**: The template uses GetIt for dependency injection, making the codebase more modular and easier to test.

4. **Theme Management**: Includes a robust theme management system with support for light and dark themes, demonstrating how to handle app-wide state changes.

This template is particularly useful for:

- Teams working on medium to large-scale Flutter applications
- Developers who want to learn Clean Architecture implementation in Flutter
- Projects requiring a solid foundation with best practices already in place
- Applications that need robust state management and theme handling

## 🔐 Authentication & Token Management

The template includes a robust authentication system with secure token handling and refresh flows. Key points:

### Token Management

- Access token and refresh token support
- Token storage abstraction (implementations can use secure/encrypted storage)
- Token rotation and secure removal on logout

### Authentication Flow

- Handles 401 responses by attempting a silent refresh using a refresh token
- Provides an `onTokenRefresh` callback hook used by the network layer to retry failed requests after refresh
- Session management with optional automatic logout on irrecoverable auth failures

### Implementation Details

- `TokenManager` + `TokenInterceptor` integrated in `DioNetworkServiceImpl`
- `onTokenRefresh` callback is supported to coordinate refresh logic from the DI layer
- Concurrent-request handling: requests wait for an ongoing refresh to complete to avoid multiple refresh calls
- Storage and rotation are implemented in a modular way so you can replace the storage backend (e.g., secure storage)

## 📰 Posts feature

This template includes a ready-to-use "Posts" feature that demonstrates:

- Loading paginated data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder)
- Local search across the currently loaded posts
- Pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling (load more when user reaches near bottom)
- Proper error handling and user-friendly retry UI

Implementation highlights:

- Endpoint: `GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` (configured at `lib/core/utility/api_endpoints.dart`)
- Pagination: query params `_page` and `_limit` (the `PostBloc` uses `_limit = 10` and manages `_page`)
- UI: `PostScreen` (route: `Routes.postsScreen` — `/posts`) includes a search bar, `RefreshIndicator`, and a `ListView` with infinite scroll
- Searching: search happens locally on the loaded posts (no extra network calls) and is handled by the bloc's `_filterPosts` method
- Screenshot: `screenshots/post_list_screen.png` shows the posts list UI

## 🌐 Networking & Dio error handling

Networking is implemented with Dio and a small service layer (`DioNetworkServiceImpl`) that:

- Wraps Dio calls and returns a typed `Either<CustomError, Response>` to the domain layer
- Adds `TokenInterceptor` when a `TokenManager` is provided to automatically inject auth headers and handle token refresh
- Provides `onTokenRefresh` callback support so DI layer code can perform refresh and tell the network service to retry

Error handling:

- Centralized in `lib/core/base/error/error_handler.dart`
- Translates `DioException` types into a `CustomError` with friendly messages and an `ErrorType` (timeout, network, server, unauthorized, notFound, etc.)
- Handles connection errors, timeouts, HTTP status codes (400/401/403/404/5xx), and unknown errors
- The repository and usecase layers return these errors up to blocs, which show friendly UI and retry options
